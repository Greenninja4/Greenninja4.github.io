I go through phases of music every few months. Creating a new playlist for each season gives me something fun to listen to throughout the day while working.

I've recently been in a future funk / vaporwave phase (Fusq, Moe Shop, etc.). Their music is quite weeb-ish, but it has a lot going on so I enjoy it. In addition, I have also been listening to electronic pop (Chainsmokers, Cash Cash, etc.).

I hope you give some of the songs a listen. Who knows, maybe you'll like some of them!
